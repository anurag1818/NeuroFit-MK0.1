# Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Device not visible over BLE | Advertising not started or wrong board flash | Check serial log for startup and BLE readiness | Reflash firmware, verify `setupBLE()` completes |
| Connect succeeds but no telemetry | UUID/characteristic mismatch | Compare frontend requested UUIDs with firmware UUIDs | Standardize UUID map and update parser |
| Frequent emergency alerts | Motion artifacts or aggressive thresholds | Review raw signal quality and movement context | Add filtering, tune thresholds, debounce events |
| SpO2/HR values unrealistic | Placeholder simulation path active | Inspect firmware `updateHRSpO2()` logic | Integrate real MAX30102 driver and calibration |
| No SMS sent | API key/device ID invalid or network issue | Check API responses and HTTP errors | Move secrets to env vars and verify account settings |
| Login works but weak security | Plaintext password storage | Inspect auth model and login flow | Add salted hashing and secure session settings |

## Frontend-Specific Issues

1. Browser blocks Bluetooth on insecure origin: use HTTPS or localhost.
2. Geolocation denied: emergency payload lacks location.
3. Missing script file references can break charts and data pages.

## Firmware-Specific Issues

1. Loop timing jitter can affect EEG sampling quality.
2. Blocking delays in alert patterns may reduce responsiveness.
3. IMU initialization should be explicitly invoked at startup.
