## Design Notes

- EEG processing is currently frequency-band oriented, not waveform-diagnostic.
- Motion/fall detection combines free-fall and orientation change checks.
- Battery mapping uses a simple linear approximation between 3.0 V and 3.7 V.

## Hardware Constraints

1. Analog front-end quality and electrode placement dominate EEG signal quality.
2. Motion artifacts can heavily contaminate EXG channels.
3. Battery percentage estimation is coarse without load/temperature compensation.
