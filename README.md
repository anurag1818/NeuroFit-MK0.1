# **Project Proposal**: Mind and Health Tracker Device with Real-Time Data Visualization, Emergency Alerts, and Predictive Mood Analytics
---
1. **Overview**

The Mind and Health Tracker is an innovative wearable device designed to monitor and improve the user's mental and physical well-being. The device will be a headband equipped with several sensors to track brain waves, heart rate variability (HRV), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Data will be transmitted wirelessly to a web application via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), where it will be stored in a secure database and visualized in real-time.
This solution will integrate advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the user's mood based on the data received and will provide recommendations for mental relaxation, including guided meditation sessions. Additionally, in case of emergencies (such as unusual brain wave activity, heart rate irregularities, SpO2 anomalies, or a fall), an automatic emergency alert will be sent to a pre-set contact with the user's location.

2. **Hardware Components**

- Seed Studio Xiao nRF52840:


The main microcontroller that acts as the heart of the device. This will be responsible for managing communication, processing sensor data, and connecting to the mobile application via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).


- BioAmp EXG Pill:


A device to capture the electrical signals from the brain, allowing us to track brain waves. These signals will be analyzed and classified based on frequency to differentiate between various brain states (e.g., relaxed, stressed, focused, etc.).


- MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter:


This sensor will monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), which are critical parameters for assessing physical health. These readings will be sent in real-time to the web application.


- Vibration Motor:


Used for feedback mechanisms, such as notifying the user about abnormal readings or prompting for specific actions (like beginning a meditation session).

3. **Software Components**

Web Application (Frontend):


The web application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle the user interface and real-time data visualization.


Key Features of the Web Application:


Real-time Data Visualization:


Display heart rate, SpO2, and brain wave data on interactive charts in real-time.


Show the different brain wave frequency bands (e.g., Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma).


Heart rate and SpO2 data visualization on separate plots, with historical data stored in the database.


Mood Prediction via ML Model:


A machine learning model will predict the user’s mood based on the collected data.


This predictive analysis will display a mood score on the dashboard.


Guided Meditation:


Based on real-time data (e.g., stress levels), the application will provide personalized meditation guides to help the user relax and improve mental health.


Emergency Alert System:


In the event of an emergency (e.g., fall detection, abnormal brain wave patterns, abnormal heart rate, or SpO2), the application will automatically send an alert to a pre-configured emergency contact with the user's location. The app will use the phone’s GPS to send the location.


Backend (Flask):


Database Management:


All data (brain waves, heart rate, SpO2, mood predictions, and emergency alerts) will be stored in a secure database (PostgreSQL or MySQL), ensuring privacy and quick access to historical data.


Real-Time Communication:


The backend will handle BLE communication and store incoming data from the device in real-time.


User Authentication:


A login/signup page will authenticate users and ensure data privacy. Each user will have an individual profile, and the data will be accessible only to them.


Machine Learning for Mood Prediction:


Model Training:


A supervised learning model will be trained on the historical data (brain waves, heart rate, SpO2) to predict the user’s mood. This model will be continuously updated based on new data to improve prediction accuracy.


Model Output:


The mood will be predicted as a score or label (e.g., "Happy," "Stressed," "Calm," etc.) and displayed on the dashboard in real-time.

4. **Key Features and Functionalities**

Sign-Up and Login System:


Secure user authentication to store personal data securely and link device data to individual accounts.


Dashboard:


Displays real-time health data, mood predictions, and interactive charts.


Provides options to view historical data (by date) and analyze trends.


Real-Time Data Monitoring:


Continuous monitoring of brain waves, heart rate, and SpO2 with live plots.


Historical data can be visualized based on date, offering insights into trends and personal health history.


Emergency Contact Notification:


In the case of an emergency, the device will send an automatic alert to the user’s pre-defined emergency contact with location and health status.


Meditation Mode:


Offers guided meditation based on the user’s stress levels and health data, allowing users to relax and improve their mental health.

5. **Workflow**

Data Collection:


The sensors on the device (Xiao nRF52840) will collect data continuously. The BioAmp EXG Pill will detect brain wave activity, and the MAX30102 will record heart rate and SpO2 data.

-->

BLE Transmission:


Data will be sent in real-time to the web application via BLE. The device will also send periodic data updates to the Django backend for storage.

-->

Data Analysis:


The backend processes incoming data, performs any necessary analysis, and updates the web app’s user interface.

-->

Emergency Monitoring:


Continuous monitoring for unusual activity (e.g., irregular heart rate, brain wave patterns, or fall detection) will trigger an emergency alert if detected.

-->

User Interaction:


The user can check their current mood, heart rate, and brain waves from the web app.


Guided meditation sessions can be started to help the user reduce stress.
